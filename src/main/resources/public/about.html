    <title>Drawings Alter Humility</title>

        <p>The game begins by choosing a starting prompt for your booklet from the list of random phrases.
      That prompt will then be drawn by the player next in line (if there are an even number of players thats you; if there are an odd number then thats someone else). Your booklet is then passed to another player who can only see the drawing. They are tasked with guessing the phrase that the previous player was trying to draw. After they guess, the next player has to draw their guess. This pattern continues until the booklet makes it way through every player. The game always ends with a guessing round. When the drawing and guessing is over, the fun part begins! You will vote on every player's submissions, and see first hand how quickly things go down the gutter!</p>
